# Image Scanner App

This application allows users to upload an image, which is then stored in Azure Blob Storage and processed using Microsoft Cognitive Services' Computer Vision AI API. The AI analyzes the image and returns a detailed textual description, which is displayed to the user. To optimize performance, the application caches responses for repeated image uploads. This project showcases effective use of AI integration, cloud storage, and object-oriented programming practices to create a seamless user experience.
